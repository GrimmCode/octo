                        <h2>Leaked Documents</h2><p>A purported Foxconn document has been leaked online today, the document includes manufacturing schematic which reiterates recent reports about the iPhone 6s having a 12 megapixel rear camera as well as 2GB of RAM. It’s quite soon for Apple to be talking about its next-generation iPhone so there’s no confirmation yet from the company regarding this and it’s very unlikely that it will say something before the time is due to show off the next iPhone.&nbsp;This purported Foxconn document was first leaked on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, by someone who claimed to be a Foxconn employee but that post has since been taken offline. Nevertheless those images have been circulating online and include a N66 and N71 model number for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus respectively.</p><p>Aside from the 12 megapixel rear camera with 4K video recording support and 2GB RAM the next-generation iPhone is said to come with a 5 megapixel front facing camera which will be a significant improvement over the existing 1.2 megapixel shooter on iPhone 6. Apple isn’t expected to unveil its new iPhones before the fall, we can’t expect the company to say something about the new smartphones before the time is right, don’t forget to take this information with a grain of salt for now.<br></p>

                        <h2>iTunes Match in Apple music causing Problems already?</h2><p>Apple Music launched a couple of days ago, and one of the service's features is the ability to match and upload songs from your existing personal music library so that you can stream them from anywhere. This feature, also available as a standalone product called 'iTunes Match', unfortunately hasn't been working well for many Apple users.&nbsp;Many people who were already using iTunes Match before switching to Apple Music are reporting that the service has been altering their cloud music libraries without their permission. The most common issues include album artwork being changed, and tracks being moved from their correct albums to completely different albums for seemingly no reason at all.</p><p>Some users have been experiencing more serious issues, such as Apple Music completely deleting their iCloud music library after migrating from iTunes Match to the new music streaming service.<br></p>

As the Korean news site Naver writes in a report, the company is already planning the Apple Watch 2, due sometime next year. It will be almost identical to the first watch in terms of hardware.&nbsp;The device will keep its rectangular screen, and will come in the same sizes – 38mm and 42mm. The resolutions will also stay intact, meaning the 38mm one will have a 340 x 272 resolution, while the 42mm one will have a 390 x 312. LG will continue to provide AMOLED displays for the Apple Watch, including the second-gen versions though the company will not be the exclusive provider of Apple Watch 2 screens, a report by BGR says.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung is apparently also going to manufacture Apple Watch 2 screens. It’s being rumoured that the device will use the flexible OLED display, which would make room for a (much needed) bigger battery, as well as make the device thinner.<br></p>

                <p>The latest update to Apple’s iOS may have only been available to the public for a couple of days, but complaints are starting to emerge. Reports are circulating that iOS 8.4 is a huge drain on the user’s battery life and apparently &nbsp;is Apple Music fault. If you have already downloaded iOS 8.4, you may have to adjust your smartphone settings to prolong your battery life and it’s always a good idea to check if apps are running in the background.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Regarding Apple Music, streaming services can be a huge battery drain whether you’re using Wi-Fi or mobile data, so you may want to download songs and listen to them locally if possible.Apple Music does seem to be experiencing some &nbsp;problems, the service has experienced some high-profile endorsements from musicians over the last week. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke, who had pulled material from rival platform Spotify, has decided to include his solo music on the service, while Taylor Swift has also made her tracks available after resolving a dispute over royalties.</p>

                            <h3 style="color: #fff">iOS 8.4 to also end Home sharing!</h3> <p style="color: #fff">With the introduction of iOS 8.4, Apple launched Apple Music and with the iCloud Music Library, basically this syncs your music across your devices thus letting you stream your music library wherever you are. This is great if you’re the only one at home using the computer, but if you’re not and you rely on a central computer, iOS 8.4 might not be the update for you.&nbsp;It has been noted that with iOS 8.4, Apple basically killed off the Home Sharing feature. For those unfamiliar, Home Sharing is a feature that was launched in 2011. Basically it lets users stream content from a central computer running iTunes onto their mobile devices, like the iPhone or iPad. This is great if you and your family store you music centrally, meaning that wherever you are at home, you can stream it as long as your computer and iOS device is connected to the same network. However like we said, with iOS 8.4, the feature has basically been killed off as far as iOS devices are concerned.&nbsp;Home Sharing is available on desktops running iTunes and Apple TV so there’s still that. We suppose iCloud Music Library is an alternative but you will need to be subscribed to Apple Music to use it, versus Home Sharing where anyone could access it for free.</p><!--StartFragment--><!--EndFragment-->

                        <h2>Seeing an old-friend. "I felt a lot of the real Jobs"</h2><p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says parts of the trailer for the upcoming biopic Steve Jobs are inaccurate—but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t like the direction the movie is taking. In the trailer, Wozniak (played by Seth Rogen) confronts Jobs (Michael Fassbender) about his lack of technical skills. “What do you do?” the film’s Wozniak says. “You’re not an engineer. You’re not a designer. You can’t put a hammer to a nail. I built the circuit board. The graphical interface was stolen. So how come, 10 times in a day, I read ‘Steve Jobs is a genius?'”.</p><p>In an interview with Bloomberg, the real Wozniak says he never uttered those exact words, but their spirit “carried the right message” about his relationship with Jobs, who quickly became the face of the company the two men co-founded.</p><p>“I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated,” Wozniak said.&nbsp;The trailer paints Jobs in a less-than-flattering light, showing him going on tirades against employees and disavowing his own daughter. The movie, written by The Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin, debuts on Oct. 9.<br></p>

                        <h2>Intel's President leaves &nbsp;the office</h2><p>A company representative said James' departure "has no effect on Intel's commitment to diversity and inclusion or our diversity initiative," adding that its commitment to inclusion and its progress so far "remains strong." The representative also pointed out that Intel will continue to have several women in major roles, including Diane Bryant leading Intel's data-center group, Kim Stevenson heading IT and Ann Kelleher leading Intel's global factory network. However, Aicha Evans, a wireless technologies general manager who has been rising in the ranks at Intel, was elevated to the company's management committee, Intel said Thursday, a sign of the company's interest in bringing up women in critical roles amid its 75 percent-male workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>"When Brian and I were appointed to our current roles," James said in a letter to Intel employees, "I knew then that being the leader of a company was something that I desired as part of my own leadership journey. Now is the right time for me to take that next step."&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>You might not be reciving Windows 10 on july 29th</h2><p>&nbsp;you might have to wait until later to get it. Microsoft said today that it would be rolling out Windows 10 in waves, "slowly scaling up" the rollout as it sees how things are going. The intention seems to be playing it safe and making sure that Windows 10 is getting a good response and running smoothly across the millions of different systems out there. Microsoft may even issue updates to Windows 10 between its July 29th release date and the time that some early adopters are actually able to download it.&nbsp;</p><p>In a new Windows blog post Microsoft Vice President of Operating Systems Terry Myerson revealed Windows 10 will actually have a staggered roll-out and the majority of new customers will actually have to wait in line.&nbsp;Microsoft says that it's found the "vast majority" of systems running Windows 7 and 8 to be fully compatible with Windows 10. Manufacturers will have Windows 10 in their hands soon to begin putting it on new machines, and retailers will receive a separate build that can be used to help update eligible devices that were bought with Windows 8.1. Windows 10 Pro's availability will also begin on July 29th. Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education will be available a few days later, on August 1st.</p>

In the next two years, the change will boost Microsoft’s state tax bill by $57 million, the state estimates. Over four years, the company will pay an additional $128 million.

                        <h2>Google's chatbot&nbsp;</h2><p>Chatbots are pretty common these days -- a simple search can surface numerous variants you can talk to on a lonely Friday night. The one Google is developing, however, isn't your run-of-the-mill chatbot: it wasn't programmed to respond to questions a specific way. Instead, it uses neural networks (a collection of machines that mimic the neurons in the human brain) to learn from existing conversations and conjure up its own answers. Mountain View, along with Facebook and Microsoft, already uses neural networks for other purposes, such as to create works of art, to identify objects in images and to recognize spoken words.</p>

                        <h2>Robot Kills Worker at Volkswagen Plant in Germany</h2><p>A robot has crushed a man to death at a Volkswagen production plant in Germany. The company confirmed the death on Wednesday.&nbsp;The 22-year-old German worker was a technician installing a stationary robot, which is programmed to complete a series of tasks in the assembly process by grabbing parts and manipulating them. The incident occurred at the factory in Baunatal, which assembles car components for other plants. The robot grabbed and crushed the technician against a metal plate. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but later died of his injuries. Volkswagen has not released the man’s name.&nbsp;But before you start believing this is an early sign of an impending robot apocalypse, Volkswagen spokesman Heiko Hillwig suggests that human error was to blame rather than a ‘rogue’ robot, the Associated Press reports. Workers in the plant are usually separated from the robots, which operate within a confined area, but in this instance, the victim was working on the robot inside the cage when he was attacked. Another worker who was present during the accident was not harmed, Hillwig said.&nbsp;Currently, there isn’t a lot of information available on the details of the case, but it is being investigated by German authorities. The other worker who witnessed the incident has declined to give further details about the case while the investigation is ongoing. Prosecutors, who are looking into how the accident occurred, have yet to decide whether charges will be brought against anyone involved.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2>Can Xiaomi Reach Its Goals for 2015 Sales&nbsp;</h2><p>Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi has announced that it sold nearly 35 million handsets in the first six months of 2015, a year-on-year increase of 33 percent. Xiaomi sold 61 million devices last year, and while it is encouraging to see the vendor cross the halfway mark already this year, CEO Lei Jun stated that the goal for 2015 was to reach 100 million sales. Xiaomi needs to enter new markets to achieve that milestone, which is exactly what it's doing by launching the Redmi 2 in Brazil.&nbsp;The manufacturer has announced that it will build devices locally in Brazil, and with Mexico and Colombia next on the list, it is likely that Brazil will serve as Xiaomi's manufacturing hub for the Latin American region. The narrative for Xiaomi till now has been all about extraordinary growth and enviable popularity. Yet China’s upstart smartphone vendor may struggle to reach some of the loftier goals its founder Lei Jun has set, thanks to a slowdown in Chinese smartphone sales and potentially, the challenges that come with entering a new market outside of Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>Xiaomi sold 34.7 million smartphones between January and June 2015, an impressive 33% increase from last year, and 2014 was already an explosive year in sales for Xiaomi. Yet smartphone shipments in the last few months seem to be slowing for the company, and shipments so far are a ways off from Lei’s goal to sell between 80 and 100 million smartphones in 2015. China’s smartphone sales contracted for the first time in six years in the first quarter of 2015, according to IDC, because the market was reaching saturation point.<br></p>

                        <h2>A new BlackBerry, running Android OS?</h2><p>Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) has posted a high-resolution render of the device, codenamed Venice, to Twitter.&nbsp;Assuming that the screen will slide up to reveal a keyboard underneath, this phone appears to be remarkably thin. Also, as you can see, the bottom features both a headphone jack as well as the standard micro USB port that can be found on most flagships. The bottom has what looks to be a speaker grille, there are a couple of volume buttons on the side, and the phone looks to be curved a bit like the S6 Edge.</p><p>Last month, Reuters originally reported that BlackBerry would make the switch to Android. If this render proves accurate (and Blass has a long history of posting accurate leaks), it might well be coming soon. It's been a very long time since there's been a decent Android device with a physical keyboard and an even longer time since there's been a vertical sliding phone with a physical keyboard. If BlackBerry pulls this off and actually releases something good, a lot of old Palm Pre fans are going to be pretty happy.<br></p>

                    <p>On the software side, there a few interesting tidbits to learn. The phone render is definitely running a version of near-stock Android Lollipop, and packs many apps on top of Google’s standard offerings. BBC, Evernote, Candy Cam, Bing, and Canada Post apps are some of the notable. Additionally, the phone seems to have shortcut icons on the home screen that allow quick access to calling and texting contacts.</p>
